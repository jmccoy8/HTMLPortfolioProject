    <h3>Where I've been</h3>
    <p>Starting out my learning journey I was a freshman Theater Major in college. Thankfully I quickly learned that this was not where my passion was to be found. So I left with some invaluable social skills, life expirience, and a desire to find the right path for me. Life seems to have a funny sense of irony because I was led to a career field completely opposite of everything I had previously done. Computer programming quickly turned from a mystical unlearnable entity to a skill I desperately desired to learn. Every article I read, every book from the library made me want more. There was this whole digital world I had no idea existed and I wanted to be apart of it. Enter LaunchCode and in turn, CoderGirl. Being accepted into the Web Development tract is what started me on the path I am on now. Started with the stepping stones of HTML to CSS, on the way to JavaScirpt and React, I've found a passion for learning that I didn't know I was capable of. I want to continue to challenge myself and cement my knowledge in the front end programming languages so that I can open the door to back end languages. I think what most excites me about coding is that there is no end to what you can learn. There's a never ending supply of accomplishment to be had and I fully intend to take advantage of every bit of it.
